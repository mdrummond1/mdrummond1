 Hi there ðŸ‘‹! I'm [Matt](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-drummond-295a4a143).

**About Me**
I attended a local university and graduated in May of 2020 with my B.S in Computer Science (ðŸŽ‰ Covid grad! ðŸŽ‰)
Since then I have been working as a software engineer.
For about 3 years after graduation, I worked in a robotics lab and worked on a large range of projects. These projects include automated data entry / upload, alignment measuring systems, and even integrating a motion capture system into a robotic sealing cell! It's been a wild ride.

Since June of 2023, I've been working at a local aerospace company building web applications with ASP.NET Core Blazor.

In down time, I enjoy working in my homelab, traveling, time with loved ones, and enjoying natural beauty! ðŸŒ„
